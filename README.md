#Hands-on-11

The three types of binary search trees you mentioned—basic binary search tree, Red-Black Tree, and AVL Tree—differ mainly in terms of how they maintain balance and ensure efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.

1. #Basic Binary Search Tree (BST):
   - It's a simple binary tree where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
   - The values in the left subtree are less than the value at the root, and the values in the right subtree are greater.
   - In the basic BST, balancing is not guaranteed. If elements are inserted in sorted order, it can result in an unbalanced tree, leading to degraded performance in terms of time complexity for operations like search, insertion, and deletion.

2. #Red-Black Tree:
   - Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit for representing colors, either red or black.
   - It maintains five properties to ensure balanced operations:
     1. Every node is either red or black.
     2. The root is black.
     3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
     4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
     5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
   - These properties ensure that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path.

3. #AVL Tree:
   - AVL Tree is another self-balancing binary search tree named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis.
   - It maintains balance using a height property where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node (called the balance factor) is at most 1.
   - To maintain balance, AVL Tree performs rotations upon insertion or deletion, ensuring that the balance factor of each node remains within the specified range.
   - Due to strict balancing, AVL Trees generally have faster lookup times compared to Red-Black Trees but might require more rotations during insertion and deletion.

In summary, while basic BSTs provide a simple structure, Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees ensure balance, with Red-Black Trees typically offering faster insertion and deletion but slightly slower lookups compared to AVL Trees.
